## Introduction  
Step beyond ordinary drone flying with the DJI Neo 2 Motion Fly More Combo — where technology meets pure immersion. The included FPV goggles put you right in the pilot’s seat, transforming your view into a real-time ultra-clear flight experience. Whether maneuvering mountain trails, open landscapes, or urban skylines, the Neo 2 delivers exhilarating first-person visuals that make every flight an adventure.

## Immersive FPV Goggles Experience  
Unlike traditional drones, Neo 2’s goggles transport you into the heart of flight. Every tilt, roll, and Sweep unfolds directly through a high-definition, low-latency feed, making you feel like you’re inside the drone. This immersive control aids precise maneuvers and cinematic shot-making without missing a beat.

## Intuitive Motion Control  
Paired with the motion controller or standard remote, controlling the drone is intuitive. Tilt your hand or adjust your gaze, and the drone responds immediately. This precision is perfect for smooth tracking shots, fast action scenes, and creative aerial storytelling.

## Pro-Grade Imaging & Smart Features  
Capture stunning 4K footage at 60fps or breathtaking 4K/100fps slow motion on a stabilized dual-axis gimbal. Smart flight modes like ActiveTrack, QuickShots, and Gesture Control mean you can focus on creativity while the drone handles complex flying.

## Portable & Safe  
Weighing just 151 grams with propeller guards and omnidirectional obstacle sensors, the Neo 2 Motion Combo delivers safety and portability. Palm takeoff and hand gesture controls make flying easy and fun for beginners and pros alike.

## Extended Flight & Reliable Connectivity  
The combo includes three intelligent batteries and a two-way charging hub for up to 57 minutes of flight time combined. O4 transmission technology ensures up to 10 km of ultra-low latency HD video feed directly to your goggles.
